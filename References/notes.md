A growing body of research highlights the tremendous potential of LLMs to improve student learning outcomes. A recent scoping review identifies 53 distinct use cases for LLMs in education [@yan2024practical], ranging from automatic grading and personalised feedback to teaching support and content generation, reflecting the high versatility and scalability of LLMs. Within this expanding literature, this study centers on *AI chatbots*, conversational agents powered by LLMs, and their educational applications, reflecting their increasing prominence and potential impact in this field.

Early investigations into the use of AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, in educational settings have identified both opportunities and challenges [@farrokhnia2024swot;@noroozi2024generative]. On one hand, ChatGPT can serve as a personalised tutor, assist in drafting assignments, or generate creative prompts for classroom activities. On the other hand, concerns have been raised around academic integrity, overreliance on AI-generated content, and the need for critical thinking skills when interpreting chatbot outputs. 

A recent review of over 70 studies offers a broad look at how chatbots are used in different areas of education [@debets2025chatbots]. It groups chatbot uses by roles like tutoring, giving feedback, and helping with administrative tasks, and examines how they are designed and used. The review finds that AI chatbots generally meet their goals. For example, a quasi-experimental study with 320 middle schoolers found that an AI teaching chatbot significantly improved math knowledge [@xing2025development]. Similarly, a meta-analysis of 24 RCTs shows that AI chatbots significantly enhance student outcomes, with stronger effects in higher education [@wu2024ai]. However, most studies are short-term, may suffer from publication bias, and often lack a strong theoretical foundation. 
<!-- This emphasizes the importance of thoughtful implementation and clear pedagogical goals. -->

Despite promising results, key limitations remain. For instance, @er2024assessing found that students in a programming class performed better with instructor feedback, which was seen as more useful and fair than AI-generated feedback, highlighting the current gap between AI and human instruction. Simiarly, evidence of performance boosts from non-education settings is mixed. A meta-analysis by @vaccaro2024combinations found that human-AI teams often performed worse than either humans or AI alone, suggesting a more nuanced relationship. In education, additional concerns are that intagrating AI might encourage cheating, over-reliance, or superficial understanding [@farrokhnia2024swot;@yusuf2024generative;@eke2023chatgpt;@lee2024cheating], the risk of which is hard to evaluate without longitudinal studies.

The effectiveness of AI in education often depends on students' attitudes and perceived usefulness of AI tools, understanding which can guide curriculum design. For instance, @li2024explanatory found that K–12 students’ views on AI tools were linked to factors like readiness, confidence, and anxiety. Similar concerns have been noted from teachers' perspectives as well [@kaplan2023generative]. Our study builds on this by exploring how interaction styles, such as Socratic vs. non-Socratic, shape students' perceptions of AI helpfulness.

This study advances this literature on human-AI collaboration in educational contexts by examining the role of step-by-step reasoning and the impact of different modes of AI interaction. Additionally, it contributes to ongoing research exploring the factors that influence students' engagement with AI. Gaining insights into the value these combinations bring is crucial for developing practical guidelines for schools and educational institutions.

Most existing research focuses on general AI chatbots, like ChatGPT, which are not specifically designed for students and often lack clear pedagogical foundations. Our study highlights the importance of purposeful design and pedagogical goals, contributing to the growing field of AI chatbot design for education, or design for learning [@gavsevic2023empowering]. This research calls for a multidisciplinary approach combining pedagogy and human-computer interaction. Building on recent efforts [@dai2023can; @yan2024practical; @joksimovic2023opportunities], we examine how K–12 students interact with different AI chatbot styles. By doing so, thee study underscores both the potential and challenges of applying classical pedagical methods, such as the Socratic approach, emphasizing the need to provide explanations rather than just answers.

<!-- Much of the existing research focused on ready-made AI chatbots, like ChatGPT. These chatbots have not been developed specifically for students and do not necessarily follow clear pedagogical principles. Our study emphasizes the importance of thoughtful implementation and clear pedagogical goals. As such it contributes to a growing research about designing AI chatbots specific education, or *design for learning* [@gavsevic2023empowering]. This research highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach that blends pedagogy with human-computer interaction. Building on recent efforts to use AI for feedback, grading, and recommendations [@dai2023can; @yan2024practical; @joksimovic2023opportunities], we explore how K–12 students engage with different AI interaction styles. The study stresses the opportunities and challenges of applying classical methods like the Socratic approach and the importance of offering explanations, not just solutions. -->

## NOTES 


- Beyond math, a broad meta-analysis on impacts on learning outcomes, motivation/itnerest, learning self-efficacy, emotions such as anxiety, value of learning revealed that xxxx [@wu2024ai]


- Most of common research focuses on commercial chatbots, such as ChatGPT, not designed to follow specific pedagogical principles [@memarian2023chatgpt]. Theory suggests that chatbots should integrate pedagogical principles and that it is feasible, as LLMs can be instructed to follow different principles. However, there is limited evidence on what pedagogical approaches work better. Here we provide evidence of Socratic.

@farrokhnia2024swot provides a simple framework to examine ChatGPT Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. 

@debets2025chatbots provides a systematic review of the effectiveness of chatbots in education with over 70 studies. 

@noroozi2024generative collected 17 studies that, through different methodologies, demonstrate that genAI tools, including ChatGPT, can significantly improve educational outcomes.

@er2024assessing experiment assessing the impact of AI-generated feedback on students in software programming class. Results revealed that students performed better with instructor feedback, which was perceived as more useful, encouraging, and fair than AI feedback.

@yan2024practical's scoping review finds 53 use cases for LLMs in education, which can be grouped in: grading, feedback (peer-review), content generation (questions), recommendation, profiling/labelling (classification), teaching support, and detection (confusion detection), knowledge representation (knowledge graphs/).
