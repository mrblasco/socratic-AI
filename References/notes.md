@farrokhnia2024swot provides a simple framework to examine ChatGPT Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. 

@debets2025chatbots provides a systematic review of the effectiveness of chatbots in education with over 70 studies. 


@er2024assessing experiment assessing the impact of AI-generated feedback on students in software programming class. Results revealed that students performed better with instructor feedback, which was perceived as more useful, encouraging, and fair than AI feedback.

@noroozi2024generative collected 17 studies that, through different methodologies, demonstrate that genAI tools, including ChatGPT, can significantly improve educational outcomes.

@yan2024practical's scoping review finds 53 use cases for LLMs in education, which can be grouped in: grading, feedback (peer-review), content generation (questions), recommendation, profiling/labelling (classification), teaching support, and detection (confusion detection), knowledge representation (knowledge graphs/).
