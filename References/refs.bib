	abstract = {Recently, ChatGPT, a cutting-edge large language model, has emerged as a powerful Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tool with the capacity to influence education. ChatGPT provides ample opportunities for learners, researchers, educators, and practitioners to achieve the intended learning outcomes in various disciplines. This special issue examines the diverse applications and implications of GenAI tools including ChatGPT in education, highlighting their potential to enhance teaching and learning across various contexts. Key findings from seventeen studies collected in this special issue demonstrate that GenAI tools can significantly improve educational outcomes by providing personalized feedback, facilitating language learning, and supporting both qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. The findings emphasize GenAI's capacity to increase learner engagement and motivation, yet also underscore the need for robust ethical guidelines and human oversight due to potential issues with privacy, bias, and accuracy. This special issue also highlights the challenges GenAI faces, such as limitations in contextual understanding and its impact on critical thinking skills. In addition, it provides a foundational framework for exploring effective and responsible GenAI integration, aiming to enrich educational experiences. We conclude that future research should focus on the longitudinal effects of GenAI tools on learning outcomes, developing ethical frameworks for their use, and ensuring their adaptability to diverse learner populations to promote inclusive educational practices.},

  journal={British Journal of Educational Technology},
  year={2024},
	abstract = {Despite the growing research interest in the use of large language models for feedback provision, it still remains unknown how students perceive and use AI-generated feedback compared to instructor feedback in authentic settings. To address this gap, this study compared instructor and AI-generated feedback in a Java programming course through an experimental research design where students were randomly assigned to either condition. Both feedback providers used the same assessment rubric, and students were asked to improve their work based on the feedback. The feedback perceptions scale and students' laboratory assignment scores were compared in both conditions. Results showed that students perceived instructor feedback as significantly more useful than AI feedback. While instructor feedback was also perceived as more fair, developmental and encouraging, these differences were not statistically significant. Importantly, students receiving instructor feedback showed significantly greater improvements in their lab scores compared to those receiving AI feedback, even after controlling for their initial knowledge levels. Based on the findings, we posit that AI models potentially need to be trained on data specific to educational contexts and hybrid feedback models that combine AI's and instructors' strengths should be considered for effective feedback practices.},

	abstract = {ChatGPT is an AI tool that has sparked debates about its potential
implications for education. We used the SWOT analysis framework to
outline ChatGPT’s strengths and weaknesses and to discuss its oppor-
tunities for and threats to education. The strengths include using
a sophisticated natural language model to generate plausible answers,
self-improving capability, and providing personalised and real-time
responses. As such, ChatGPT can increase access to information, facil-
itate personalised and complex learning, and decrease teaching work-
load, thereby making key processes and tasks more efficient. The
weaknesses are a lack of deep understanding, difficulty in evaluating
the quality of responses, a risk of bias and discrimination, and a lack of
higher-order thinking skills. Threats to education include a lack of
understanding of the context, threatening academic integrity, perpe-
tuating discrimination in education, democratising plagiarism, and
declining high-order cognitive skills. We provide agenda for educa-
tional practice and research in times of ChatGPT},

	abstract = {Educational technology innovations leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential to automate the laborious process of generating and analysing textual content. While various innovations have been developed to automate a range of educational tasks (eg, question generation, feedback provision, and essay grading), there are concerns regarding the practicality and ethicality of these innovations. Such concerns may hinder future research and the adoption of LLMs-based innovations in authentic educational contexts. To address this, we conducted a systematic scoping review of 118 peer-reviewed papers published since 2017 to pinpoint the current state of research on using LLMs to automate and support educational tasks. The findings revealed 53 use cases for LLMs in automating education tasks, categorised into nine main categories: profiling/labelling, detection, grading, teaching support, prediction, knowledge representation, feedback, content generation, and recommendation. Additionally, we also identified several practical and ethical challenges, including low technological readiness, lack of replicability and transparency and insufficient privacy and beneficence considerations. The findings were summarised into three recommendations for future studies, including updating existing innovations with state-of-the-art models (eg, GPT-3/4), embracing the initiative of open-sourcing models/systems, and adopting a human-centred approach throughout the developmental process. As the intersection of AI and education is continuously evolving, the findings of this study can serve as an essential reference point for researchers, allowing them to leverage the strengths, learn from the limitations, and uncover potential research opportunities enabled by ChatGPT and other generative AI models.},

  journal={Scientific Reports},
  volume={14},
  number={1},
  pages={13922},
  year={2024},
	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) holds immense promise for K-12 education, yet understanding the factors influencing students’ engagement with AI courses remains a challenge. This study addresses this gap by extending the technology acceptance model (TAM) to incorporate cognitive factors such as AI intrinsic motivation (AIIM), AI readiness (AIRD), AI confidence (AICF), and AI anxiety (AIAX), alongside human–computer interaction (HCI) elements like user interface (UI), content (C), and learner-interface interactivity (LINT) in the context of using generative AI (GenAI) tools. By including these factors, an expanded model is presented to capture the complexity of student engagement with AI education. To validate the model, 210 Chinese students spanning grades K7 to K9 participated in a 1 month artificial intelligence course. Survey data and structural equation modeling reveal significant relationships between cognitive and HCI factors and perceived usefulness (PU) and ease of use (PEOU). Specifically, AIIM, AIRD, AICF, UI, C, and LINT positively influence PU and PEOU, while AIAX negatively affects both. Furthermore, PU and PEOU significantly predict students’ attitudes toward AI curriculum learning. These findings underscore the importance of considering cognitive and HCI factors in the design and implementation of AI education initiatives. By providing a theoretical foundation and practical insights, this study informs curriculum development and aids educational institutions and businesses in evaluating and optimizing AI4K12 curriculum design and implementation strategies.

	abstract = {Many real-world problems require the combined application of multiple reasoning abilities employing suitable abstractions, commonsense knowledge, and creative synthesis of problem-solving strategies. To help advance AI systems towards such capabilities, we propose a new reasoning challenge, namely Fermi Problems (FPs), which are questions whose answers can only be approximately estimated because their precise computation is either impractical or impossible. For example, "How much would the sea level rise if all ice in the world melted?" FPs are commonly used in quizzes and interviews to bring out and evaluate the creative reasoning abilities of humans. To do the same for AI systems, we present two datasets: 1) A collection of 1k real-world FPs sourced from quizzes and olympiads; and 2) a bank of 10k synthetic FPs of intermediate complexity to serve as a sandbox for the harder real-world challenge. In addition to question answer pairs, the datasets contain detailed solutions in the form of an executable program and supporting facts, helping in supervision and evaluation of intermediate steps. We demonstrate that even extensively fine-tuned large scale language models perform poorly on these datasets, on average making estimates that are off by two orders of magnitude. Our contribution is thus the crystallization of several unsolved AI problems into a single, new challenge that we hope will spur further advances in building systems that can reason.},

	abstract = {ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. However, the effect of using ChatGPT in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard. {\copyright} 2023},

@article{gilburt2023machine,
	abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence is changing how we can choose to resolve writing challenges. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are readily accessible to generate text effortlessly. This paper explores the human-AI relationship when generative AI is used to assist a writer suffering from writer's block. Research shows that talking to others is an effective strategy for blocked writers. This other no longer needs to be a human. I examine what happens when generative AI is brought into the writing loop: the nonlinear process of writing and rewriting a creative piece. The film Adaptation (2002. Directed by Spike Jonze, Performance by Nicolas Cage. Meryl Streep, and Chris Cooper. Columbia), written by Charlie Kaufman, is used as a case study of writer's block to illustrate several complexities of the disorder and to theorise potential openings and limitations for the use of AI. Through the film, writer's block is also explored as having a twin pathology of hypergraphia. Writing with AI is seen to mimic peculiarities of creative writing that include projecting one's inner voice and seeking a false self. In the example of Adaptation, one ultimately comes to appreciate too that suffering through a block unaided can propel a writer to make bold decisions and test the limits of human creativity. {\copyright} 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The release of ChatGPT has sparked significant academic integrity concerns in higher education. However, some commentators have pointed out that generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT can enhance student learning, and consequently, academics should adapt their teaching and assessment practices to embrace the new reality of living, working, and studying in a world where AI is freely available. Despite this important debate, there has been very little academic literature published on ChatGPT and other generative AI tools. This article uses content analysis to examine news articles (N=100) about how ChatGPT is disrupting higher education, concentrating specifically on Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. It explores several key themes, including university responses, academic integrity concerns, the limitations and weaknesses of AI tool outputs, and opportunities for student learning. The data reveals mixed public discussion and university responses, with a focus mainly on academic integrity concerns and opportunities for innovative assessment design. There has also been a lack of public discussion about the potential for ChatGPT to enhance participation and success for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Similarly, the student voice is poorly represented in media articles to date. This article considers these trends and the impact of AI tools on student learning at university. {\copyright} 2023.

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have been progressing constantly and being more visible in different aspects of our lives. One recent phenomenon is ChatGPT, a chatbot with a conversational artificial intelligence interface that was developed by OpenAI. As one of the most advanced artificial intelligence applications, ChatGPT has drawn much public attention across the globe. In this regard, this study examines ChatGPT in education, among early adopters, through a qualitative instrumental case study. Conducted in three stages, the first stage of the study reveals that the public discourse in social media is generally positive and there is enthusiasm regarding its use in educational settings. However, there are also voices who are approaching cautiously using ChatGPT in educational settings. The second stage of the study examines the case of ChatGPT through lenses of educational transformation, response quality, usefulness, personality and emotion, and ethics. In the third and final stage of the study, the investigation of user experiences through ten educational scenarios revealed various issues, including cheating, honesty and truthfulness of ChatGPT, privacy misleading, and manipulation. The findings of this study provide several research directions that should be considered to ensure a safe and responsible adoption of chatbots, specifically ChatGPT, in education. {\copyright} 2023, The Author(s).},

@article{ibrahim2023perception,
	abstract = {The emergence of large language models has led to the development of powerful tools such as ChatGPT that can produce text indistinguishable from human-generated work. With the increasing accessibility of such technology, students across the globe may utilize it to help with their school work---a possibility that has sparked ample discussion on the integrity of student evaluation processes in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). To date, it is unclear how such tools perform compared to students on university-level courses across various disciplines. Further, students' perspectives regarding the use of such tools in school work, and educators' perspectives on treating their use as plagiarism, remain unknown. Here, we compare the performance of the state-of-the-art tool, ChatGPT, against that of students on 32 university-level courses. We also assess the degree to which its use can be detected by two classifiers designed specifically for this purpose. Additionally, we conduct a global survey across five countries, as well as a more in-depth survey at the authors' institution, to discern students' and educators' perceptions of ChatGPT's use in school work. We find that ChatGPT's performance is comparable, if not superior, to that of students in a multitude of courses. Moreover, current AI-text classifiers cannot reliably detect ChatGPT's use in school work, due to both their propensity to classify human-written answers as AI-generated, as well as the relative ease with which AI-generated text can be edited to evade detection. Finally, there seems to be an emerging consensus among students to use the tool, and among educators to treat its use as plagiarism. Our findings offer insights that could guide policy discussions addressing the integration of artificial intelligence into educational frameworks. {\copyright} 2023, The Author(s).},

This study aims to investigate and explore teaching strategies that effectively enhance pupils' concentration in distance music classes. The descriptive survey method was employed to collect, analyze, and interpret the data to meet the study's objectives. Students' (N = 45) behavior in thirteen (13) distance music classes in Changsha County China was tracked and observed, and two rural school assistant teachers (N = 2) were interviewed. Text data recorded from observations and interviews were analyzed and categorized qualitatively. The research results indicated that the visual and audio support, incorporation of music games, and progressive learning of rhythms et al. can effectively improve students' concentration in distance music classes. The article also suggests: (1) conducting clear and engaging classroom tasks; (2) mixing body rhythm participation; (3) building a harmonious teacher-student relationship; (4) creating sustainable online learning environments; and (5) utilizing ChatGPT assistance in future distance music teaching practice. {\copyright} 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 prompted widespread concern about the implications of artificial intelligence for academic integrity, but thus far there has been little direct empirical evidence to inform this debate. Participants (69 high school teachers, 140 high school students, total N=209) took an AI Identification Test in which they read pairs of essays - one written by a high school student and the other by ChatGPT - and guessed which was generated by the chatbot. Accuracy was only 70% for teachers, and it was slightly worse for students (62%). Self-reported confidence did not predict accuracy, nor did experience with ChatGPT or subject-matter expertise. Well-written student essays were especially hard to differentiate from the ChatGPT texts. In another set of measures, students reported greater optimism than their teachers did about the future role of ChatGPT in education. Students expressed disapproval of submitting ChatGPT-generated essays as one's own but rated this and other possible academic integrity violations involving ChatGPT less negatively than teachers did. These results form an empirical basis for further work on the relationship between AI and academic integrity. {\copyright} 2023 Tal Waltzer et al.},

@article{Wu2023,
	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are gaining increasing popularity in education. Due to their increasing popularity, many empirical studies have been devoted to exploring the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The proliferation of experimental studies has highlighted the need to summarize and synthesize the inconsistent findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. However, few reviews focused on the meta-analysis of the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The present study performed a meta-analysis of 24 randomized studies utilizing Stata software (version 14). The main goal of the current study was to meta-analytically examine the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes and the moderating effects of educational levels and intervention duration. The results indicated that AI chatbots had a large effect on students' learning outcomes. Moreover, AI chatbots had a greater effect on students in higher education, compared to those in primary education and secondary education. In addition, short interventions were found to have a stronger effect on students' learning outcomes than long interventions. It could be explained by the argument that the novelty effects of AI chatbots could improve learning outcomes in short interventions, but it has worn off in the long interventions. Future designers and educators should make attempt to increase students' learning outcomes by equipping AI chatbots with human-like avatars, gamification elements and emotional intelligence. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have been gaining increasing popularity in education. Studies undertaken so far have provided conflicting evidence concerning the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. There has remained a paucity of meta-analyses synthesizing the contradictory findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. What this paper adds This study, through meta-analysis, synthesized these recent findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. This study found that AI chatbots could have a large effect on students' learning outcomes. This study found that the effects of AI chatbots were moderated by educational levels and intervention duration. Implications for practice and/or policy AI chatbot designers could make AI chatbots better by equipping AI chatbots with human-like avatars, gamification elements and emotional intelligence Practitioners and/or teachers should draw attention to the positive and negative effects of AI chatbots on students. Considering the importance of ChatGPT, more research is required to develop a better understanding of the effects of ChatGPT in education. More research is needed to examine the mechanisms underlying the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. {\copyright} 2023 British Educational Research Association.},

@article{Chocarro2023295,
	abstract = {The appearance of Artificial Intelligence implementations, such as text-based virtual assistants (chatbots) in education is relatively new. These implementations can be useful for helping teachers and students to solve both educational questions and routine tasks. This paper examines the factors that explain teachers' acceptance of chatbots through the dimensions of the Technology Acceptance Model (perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use), its conversational design (use of social language and proactiveness), and the teachers' age and digital skills. The data collection process included a pre-test and an online survey with four different types of chatbots. We analyse 225 responses of primary and secondary education teachers. The results show that the perceived easiness and perceived usefulness leads to greater acceptance of chatbots. As for the chatbots' features, formal language by a chatbot leads to a higher intention of using them. These results can help in chatbot design and communication decisions, improving the acceptance of the educational community. {\copyright} 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Background: The use of chatbots as learning assistants is receiving increasing attention in language learning due to their ability to converse with students using natural language. Previous reviews mainly focused on only one or two narrow aspects of chatbot use in language learning. This review goes beyond merely reporting the specific types of chatbot employed in past empirical studies and examines the usefulness of chatbots in language learning, including first language learning, second language learning, and foreign language learning. Aims: The primary purpose of this review is to discover the possible technological, pedagogical, and social affordances enabled by chatbots in language learning. Materials & Methods: We conducted a systematic search and identifies 25 empirical studies that examined the use of chatbots in language learning. We used the inductive grounded approach to identify the technological and pedagogical affordances, and the challenges of using chatbots for students' language learning. We used Garrison's social presence framework to analyze the social affordances of using chatbots in language learning. Results: Our findings revealed three technological affordances: timeliness, ease of use, and personalization; and five pedagogical uses: as interlocutors, as simulations, for transmission, as helplines, and for recommendations. Chatbots appeared to encourage students' social presence by affective, open, and coherent communication. Several challenges in using chatbots were identified: technological limitations, the novelty effect, and cognitive load. Discussion and Conclusion: A set of rudimentary design principles for chatbots are proposed for meaningfully implementing educational chatbots in language learning, and detailed suggestions for future research are presented. {\copyright} 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},
